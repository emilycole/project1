## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
da36368.0001 %>% filter(!is.na(GOVT_NOSTATEACTION)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = GOVT_NOSTATEACTION, fill = GOVT_NOSTATEACTION)) + geom_bar() + 
  scale_fill_wsj(palette = "rgby", 
  name = "If the federal government fails \nto address global warming, \nit's my state's responsibilty to act") + 
  theme_wsj(base_size = 8, color = 'gray', base_family = "sans", title_family = "mono") + 
  theme(axis.text.x=element_blank(), axis.ticks.x=element_blank(), 
        legend.text = element_text(size = 7), legend.title = element_text(size = 7), legend.position = "bottom") + 
  labs(title="Should States Pick Up the \nSlack on Climate Action?")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
